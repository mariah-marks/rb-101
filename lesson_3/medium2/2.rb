# Numbers are immutable in Ruby, which means that individual integer objects
# can't be altered.
# In this example, local variables `a`, `b` and `c` all reference the same
# integer object with the value `42`. When `b` is initialized to reference an
# integer object with the value `42`, it is referencing the one only integer
# object with that value.
