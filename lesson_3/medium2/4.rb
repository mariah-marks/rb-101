# The method definition mutates the calling object referenced by local method
# variable `a_string_param` by concatenating it with "rutabaga" and assigns
# local method variable `an_array_param` to a new array object.

# The value referenced by `my_string` is the mutated string object
# "pumpkinsrutabaga".

# The value referenced by `my_array` is the original array object ["pumpkins"].

# My string looks like this now: pumpkinsrutabaga
# My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins"]
# => nil
